                My Grammy's version of lasagna. Prepared the day before and left in the fridge overnight, <br>
                it pops quickly into the oven and is on the table in no time. Sometimes I'll gussy it up <br>
                with herbs and spices, but there is something nice and simple and homey about how Grammy <br>
                made it. Easily halved or doubled!
            </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 (30 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
                    <li>¾ cup water</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>

                <h3>Directions</h3>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Step 1 </h4>
                        <p> Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over 
                            medium-high heat until browned and no longer 
                            pink, about 5 minutes; drain fat. <br>
                            Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. 
                            Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Step 2 </h4>
                    <p>
                        Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. 
                        Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over noodles. <br>
                        Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. 
                        Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. <br>
                        Top with Parmesan cheese. 
                        Cover tightly with foil; refrigerate overnight.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Step 3 </h4>
                    <p>
                        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                    </p>

                    <h4> Step 4 </h4>
                    <p> Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. 
                        Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
                    </p>
