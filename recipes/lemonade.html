            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ul>
                <h4>Step 1 </h4>
                    <p> Begin by making the candied lemon. Place the sugar and <br>
                        water in a wide-based pan and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, <br>
                        cut the lemon into 4mm thick slices. 
                    </p>

                <h4>Step 2 </h4>
                <p>
                    When the sugar syrup has been boiling for 1 minute, add the lemon <br>
                    slices and gently simmer until the rind becomes translucent this <br>
                    will take 10-15 minutes.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 3 </h4>
                <p>
                    Remove the lemons from the syrup and lay onto a tray lined with <br>
                    baking paper. Leave to air dry for at least a couple of hours until <br>
                    the slices are no longer sticky to the touch.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 4 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4. Grease three 20cm sandwich tins.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 5 </h4>
                <p> 
                    To make the sponge, cream together the butter, sugar and lemon zest until <br>
                    pale and fluffy. Add the egg a little at a time until fully incorporated, <br>
                    then fold through the flour in 2 stages.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 6 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Divide between the tins and bake for 20–25 minutes or when a metal skewer <br>
                    inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 7 </h4>
                <p> 
                    While the cakes are baking, make the lemonade syrup. Place the lemonade, sugar <br>
                    and lemon juice in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce until you are left <br>
                    with 100ml of liquid.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 8 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Turn the cakes onto a wire rack and while still warm, drizzle over the lemonade <br>
                    syrup. Leave to cool completely.
                </p>
                
                <h4> Step 9 </h4>
                <p> 
                    To make the buttercream, whip the butter in a standing mixer or with an electric <br>
                    whisk until it starts to turn white.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 10 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Mix the icing sugar with the lemon sherbet and add gradually to the butter don't <br>
                    be tempted to add too much at once or you will be left with a white kitchen!
                </p>

                <h4> Step 11 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Once all of the icing sugar is mixed in, let the buttercream down with enough lemon <br>
                    juice to give it a pipe-able consistency and transfer to a piping bag.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 12</h4>
                <p> 
                    If the cakes are slightly dome-shaped on the top, trim them slightly to make them <br>
                    level.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 13</h4>
                <p> 
                    Line an icing turntable with baking paper so that you can move the cake later on. <br>
                    Place 1 layer of cake on the turntable and pipe over a layer of icing about 1cm <br>
                    thick. Repeat with the next sponge and top with the third
                </p>
                
                <h4> Step 14</h4>
                <p> 
                    Pipe a thin layer of icing around the sides and on top of the cake and smooth it off. <br>
                    This process ensures you don't end up with any crumbs when you do the final icing. 
                </p>

                <h4> Step 15</h4>
                <p> 
                    Next, pipe the icing around the cake, piping with one hand and gently moving the <br>
                    turntable with the other until you get to the top.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 16</h4>
                <p> 
                    Holding a palette knife or pastry side-scraper against the side of the cake, slowly <br>
                    drag it around to smooth the icing off and remove any excess. You may need to do this <br>
                    2 or 3 times to get a smooth finish.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 17</h4>
                <p> 
                    Do the same thing on the top of the cake and smooth off the edges.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 18</h4>
                <p> 
                    Drag a teaspoon from the bottom to the top of the cake to create a ridged <br>
                    effect all the way around.
                </p>

                <h4> Step 19 </h4>
                <p> 
                    Top with the candied lemon slices and decorate with edible flowers.
                </p>
